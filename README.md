Auth is a Laravel module to quickly implement the authentication system into your applications, so that you don't have to implement it every time you start a new projects.

By default Laravel has its own command to create the scaffolding for a new app, but I don't like it so much. Auth uses the [Workflow](https://github.com/cerbero90/Workflow) package to implement the authentication system.

## Install

Run this command in your application root:

```
composer require cerbero/auth
```

## Usage

@TODO
